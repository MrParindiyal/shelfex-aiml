Number,Question,Answer
1,What is the primary goal of cryptography?,Cryptography aims to construct and analyze protocols to prevent unauthorized access to private messages.
2,Which disciplines intersect with modern cryptography?,"Modern cryptography combines mathematics, computer science, information security, electrical engineering, and others."
3,What are the core concepts central to cryptography?,"Data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to cryptography."
4,What is the historical synonym for cryptography?,"Prior to modern times, cryptography was synonymous with encryption."
5,"Who are Alice, Bob, and Eve in cryptography?","Alice is the sender, Bob is the intended recipient, and Eve is the eavesdropping adversary."
6,What are the two main types of cryptosystems?,The two main types of cryptosystems are symmetric and asymmetric systems.
7,What is the main advantage of asymmetric systems?,"Asymmetric systems' public key can be freely published, enabling secure communication without a shared secret key."
